		ABOUT
	</h1>
	<h2>
		<p><br>Beginning development in 2018, Sonic Forces Overclocked was originally conceptualized as an Encore Mode for Sonic Forces, before evolving into something larger.<br>Featuring 8 new stages, new cutscenes, new music, and new avatar cosmetics, Overclocked aims to be a sequel-expansion pack for the original Sonic Forces.<br>When Infinite returns with the aid of Neo Metal Sonic, and both equipped with Overclocked Phantom Rubies, they wage a devastating war against Sonic & the Resistance. With time running short, and the Resistance's forces spread thin, can they put a stop to this war before all hope is lost?</p>

			FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
		</h1>
		<h2><br>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>To play this mod, DIRECTLY EXTRACT THE CONTENTS OF THE ZIP INTO YOUR MODS DIRECTORY.<br><br>The contents of the mod are quite large, so it's recommended instead of dragging and dropping into the mod loader that you instead directly extract it into your mods directory folder, which you can find at the top of the Settings tab in the HedgeModManager. 7-Zip is also the ideal way to extract the mod, as errors may occur using other methods. Make sure you move the <b>"SFO"</b> folder that's alongside this readme into your mods directory, since it contains all the actual mod data.</li>
					<li>To play this mod, please ENABLE <b>'REDIRECT DEFAULT SAVE FILE'</b> in the HedgeModManager Settings.<br><br>The mod uses it's own unique save file that must be used in order to experience Overclocked. Using this will override your normal game save when playing Overclocked, but it will not delete it, meaning you may still return to your normal game save when not playing Overclocked.<br><br>IF YOU WANT TO START A NEW SAVE you will have to go to <b>"mods\SFO\savedata"</b> and move <b>"savedata.xml"</b> into a different folder. Then rename <b>"savedata_2.xml"</b> to <b>"savedata.xml"</b>, which will make it so you can start over from the beginning. The mod comes with 2 extra savedata files to use.</li>
					<li>To play this mod, please DO NOT ENABLE ANY OTHER MOD OR CODE in the HedgeModManager.<br><br>The mod changes nearly everything in the game, including physics, models, etc.<br><br>This means any individual other mod enabled with it may negatively effect certain parts of this mod if enabled, so it's strongly encouraged to only play with only the single mod enabled in the mod loader for the full experience.<br><br>Whilst this is the case, feel free to enable the Free Cam mod when playing Overclocked if you would like to take screenshots, as the mod does not conflict in any way with Overclocked.</li>
					<li>If you haven't already, make sure to DOWNLOAD COMMUNITY CODES UNDER THE CODES TAB in the mod loader.<br><br>This ensures that Overclocked can launch as the base game already uses codes. If you do not do this, the game will come up with an error and not launch.<br><br>5. To avoid any bugs, ENSURE YOUR GAME'S FRAME RATE IS KEPT AT 60FPS.<br><br>To ensure you don't encounter any issues with the gameplay, ensure in your in-game graphics settings that the game's framerate is capped to 60fps. DO NOT ENABLE ANY FPS CODES UNDER THE CODES TAB EITHER.</li>
					<li>FOR BEST PERFORMANCE INSTALL THE GAME AND MODS ON YOUR SSD DRIVE.<br><br>The HedgeModManager currently lags a bit while unpacking Forces files from an external drive or HDD, so you may notice lag spikes when starting up levels. This issue only lasts for around 10-15 seconds before it begins to run smoothly. Having this mod installed on an SSD can help counteract this issue should you find it too problematic.</li>
					<li>Vocal themes in the Avatar stages can be toggled in the config menu.<br><br>Right click on the mod entry in Hedgemodmanager and select <b>"Config mod"</b>. The menu there will allow you to enable and disable the vocal themes in the Avatar stages.</li>

			TROUBLESHOOTING FAQ
		</h1>
		<h2><br>
			<p><b>"The mod isn't changing anything! My game looks the same!"</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Are you using a pirated copy? If so, don't pirate the game, and instead purchase the official version, as Overclocked does not work on pirated copies of Sonic Forces. Thanks!</li>
					<li>VIs the mod loader installed? You can check if the mod loader is installed by going to your HedgeModManager settings. If the last button in the <b>"Game & Mod Loader"</b> category asks you to Install the mod loader, then install the mod loader.</li>
					<li>Is the mod loader up-to-date? Overclocked supports no earlier than HedgeModManager 7.12-4.</li>
					<li>Is the mod enabled in your mod loader? To check this, all you have to do is check the box next to <b>"Sonic Forces Overclocked"</b> and hit save.</li>
					<li>Is the mod extracted properly? Sometimes, the mod will not extract properly. We recommend using 7Zip. Also, make sure you didn't install the mod THROUGH HedgeModManager, as that often times creates installation issues.</li>
				</ol>
				<b>"My controller isn't working!"</b>
				<ol>
					<li>In HedgeModManager's settings tab, try toggling on or off the <b>"Use Game Launcher"</b> option.</li>
				</ol>
